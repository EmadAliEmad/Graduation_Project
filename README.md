# Wind Field Estimation using Sentinel-1 SAR Images

The estimation of wind fields is crucial for weather forecasting, oceanography, and offshore engineering. This project proposes a deep learning-based method for wind field estimation using complex, noisy Sentinel-1 SAR images. 

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a more accurate and reliable method for wind field estimation than traditional feature-based methods. 

## Methodology

A convolutional neural network (CNN) extracts features from the SAR images, which are then fed into a regression model to estimate the wind fields. The proposed method outperforms traditional methods, identifying complex patterns and structures in the SAR images and providing more accurate and reliable wind field estimates. 

## Results

The proposed method was evaluated using Sentinel-1 SAR images of the North Sea and English Channel, comparing the estimated wind fields with ground-truth wind fields obtained from weather buoys and atmospheric models. The achieved results showed that the proposed deep learning-based method outperformed traditional feature-based methods for wind field estimation from SAR images. 

## Applications

This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning-based methods in improving wind field estimation from SAR images. The proposed method can improve weather forecasting, oceanography, and offshore engineering, contributing to a better understanding of the Earth's environment and better prediction and response to severe weather events and natural disasters. 

## Conclusion

This project highlights the significant advantages of deep learning-based methods for wind field estimation using Sentinel-1 SAR images. Our proposed method has the potential to improve wind field estimates in complex and noisy environments, contributing to better weather forecasting, oceanography, and offshore engineering applications.
